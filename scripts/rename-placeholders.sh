# rename-placeholders.sh — turn this scaffold into a real tenant in one shot.
#
# The deploy/ manifests ship with three placeholder forms that collapse to one
# value — your tenant (repository) name:
#   • `app`       — the example app/resource name (Deployment, Service, the
#                   `app.kubernetes.io/name` label *value*, HTTPRoute, the CNPG
#                   Cluster, its database/owner, and the example hostname).
#   • REPLACE_ME  — the container image and OpenBao path.
#   • replace-me  — the tenant's Vault role and ServiceAccount.
# (Per the template convention the Deployment container `name` MUST equal the
# repository name — see README — so a single name drives everything.)
#
# Doing this by hand is easy to get half-wrong; this script renames all three
# across deploy/*.yaml in place WITHOUT corrupting the parts that must NOT
# change:
#   • the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label *key* (only its value is renamed),
#   • CloudNativePG's literal `-app` suffix on its generated secret, and
#   • the shared `openbao` SecretStore name.
#
# Usage:  scripts/rename-placeholders.sh [tenant-name]
# With no argument it defaults to the scaffold's directory name.

# Resolve the scaffold that OWNS this script — never the caller's checkout. The
# helper may be invoked by path from another repository (or any directory), and
# a cwd-derived root (git rev-parse --show-toplevel) would rewrite THAT tree's
# deploy/ instead of this one's (#61). `cd -P` pins directory symlinks to their
# physical path; a symlink to the script itself intentionally resolves relative
# to the symlink's own directory (POSIX sh has no portable readlink).
