# rename-placeholders.test.sh — exercise scripts/rename-placeholders.sh end-to-end.
#
# rename-placeholders.sh is the first thing a newcomer runs after `Use this
# template` — it rewrites the `app`, REPLACE_ME, and `replace-me` placeholders
# across deploy/*.yaml into the tenant's real name. A silent regression ships
# broken manifests to every tenant created from this scaffold, and it had no
# other coverage. The existing validation gate schema-validates the *unrenamed*
# manifests but never runs the rename, so a botched sed address would pass green.
# This test pins the script's real, subtle behaviour:
#   * REPLACE_ME values (the image and the OpenBao KV path) are repointed,
#   * every `app`-as-a-VALUE is renamed (resource names, label values, hostname,
#     the CNPG database/owner), while the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label *KEY* is
#     left intact (only its value changes),
#   * CloudNativePG's literal `-app` Secret suffix is preserved (`app-db-app`
#     becomes `<name>-db-app`, NOT `<name>-db-<name>`),
#   * the shared `openbao` SecretStore name is NOT renamed,
#   * the lowercase `replace-me` Vault role / ServiceAccount placeholders are
#     repointed to the tenant name alongside the uppercase placeholders,
#   * invalid (non-DNS-1123) names are rejected without mutating anything,
#   * no stray sed temp files are left behind, and
#   * the renamed scaffold still `kubectl kustomize`-builds (CI only).
#
# It runs the script against a throwaway copy so the real working tree is never
# mutated. Run locally with `sh scripts/rename-placeholders.test.sh`; CI runs it
# via .github/workflows/validate-scaffold.yaml.
