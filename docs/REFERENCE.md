# Template reference

The detail behind the [README](../README.md): what the placeholder rename changes, which files the
template keeps in sync and which are yours, how publishing works, and how to validate the template
locally.

## What the rename changes

`scripts/rename-placeholders.sh` rewrites the `app`, `REPLACE_ME`, and `replace-me`
placeholders in `deploy/` consistently, including the container name, Vault role,
and ServiceAccount. Those values **must** equal the repository name (see the
convention under [How publishing works](#how-publishing-works)). The helper
preserves the `app.kubernetes.io/name` label *keys*, CloudNativePG's literal `-app`
secret suffix, and the `openbao` SecretStore name. Doing this by hand is easy to get
half-wrong. It's a one-shot helper, so delete it once adopted.

The example route is renamed for both environments: `<tenant>.platform.lan`
locally and `<tenant>.platform.devantler.tech` in production. Keep both in
`deploy/httproute.yaml`; add any custom domains beside them. Each Platform
Gateway attaches only the hostnames its listener serves.

The route also publishes a tile to the Platform Homepage. The helper updates
its name, production URL, and pod selector; tailor the tile's description,
group, and icon annotations after the rename to describe your app.

## What the template owns vs. what you own

template-sync overwrites the files the template **owns** and never touches the
files **you own**. Declare the files you own in **`.templatesyncignore`** (same
syntax as `.gitignore`). template-sync only ever brings over files that exist in
this template, so you only need to ignore the scaffolding files below — not your
app code.

**Owned by the template (kept in sync — do not edit in your tenant):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/cd.yaml` | On a `v*` tag, calls `publish-app.yaml` to build, digest-pin, push, and **cosign-sign** the image + manifests OCI artifact |
| `.github/workflows/release.yaml` | semantic-release on `main` (cuts the `v*` tags that drive `cd.yaml`) |
| `.github/workflows/template-sync.yaml` | Opens the weekly template-sync PR |
| `.github/workflows/sync-labels.yaml` | Syncs the repo's issue/PR labels from the canonical label set |
| `CLAUDE.md` | `@AGENTS.md` shim |
| `docs/REFERENCE.md` | This reference |
| `scripts/workflow-caller-pin-contract.test.sh` | Runs in each tenant's required CI and rejects malformed, divergent, or rolled-back reusable-workflow pins, and a version comment that does not name the tag of the pinned commit |
| `scripts/publish-pin-approved.sh`, `scripts/publish-pin-approved.test.sh` | The check a tenant's required CI runs to refuse a moved `publish-app.yaml` pin until the platform's approved set lists it for that tenant, so a dependency PR waits instead of shipping a release the platform cannot deploy. Tenants wire it into their own `ci.yaml`; the default one a new tenant starts from does not run it ([#207](https://github.com/devantler-tech/platform-tenant-template/issues/207)) |
| `zizmor.yml` | GitHub Actions pinning policy enforced by the security scan |

**Scaffold-time only (arrives when the repo is created — never re-synced, so a
tenant still carrying these from an older sync can delete them for good):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/validate-scaffold.yaml` | Renders `deploy/`, schema-validates every resource, applies the live Platform/shared Kyverno policies, and exercises a pinned Kubernetes API. The live checks prove the template publishes through the pinned signing workflow; Platform still wires the private GHCR pull credential to the tenant identity and cosign-verifying OCI source; and Flux consumes that source while impersonating and targeting the managed `restricted` namespace for both KRO and manual registrations. They then prove the Deployment passes Pod Security `restricted`, the tenant identity can reconcile every rendered kind, and cluster-scoped or interactive privileges remain denied. It gates template PRs, re-validates `main` after every merge, and rechecks upstream drift every day at 06:17 UTC (or on manual dispatch), keeping one tracking issue open while that scheduled check fails on `main`; structural mutation tests keep every layer fail-closed. The workflow no-ops in tenants and is scaffold-time only |
| `scripts/rename-placeholders.sh` (+ its test) | One-shot rename of the placeholder app to your tenant name |
| `scripts/agent-instructions.test.sh` | Fails closed if the one-time agent scaffold loses its ownership, dependency-bot, external-code, exact-head review, pinned-merge, or user-path evaluation boundaries, or regains a retired rule |
| `scripts/workflow-caller-contract.test.sh` | Keeps the portable caller-pin contract wired into tenant CI while validating template-only publisher, release, ownership, and scaffold invariants |
| `scripts/tenant-ci-contract.test.sh` | Keeps default tenant PR CI least-privilege and fail-closed over both the image build and rendered manifests |
| `scripts/pod-security-admission*.test.sh` | Proves the rendered Deployment is accepted at Pod Security `restricted` while unsafe mutations are denied, and pins that live gate against structural bypasses |
| `scripts/tenant-rbac*.test.sh` | Proves the Platform tenant reconciliation identity can manage every rendered scaffold resource while cluster-scoped and interactive privileges stay denied |
| `scripts/platform-tenant-envelope*.test.sh` | Binds the template's signed publisher and those workload-level models to Platform's live KRO and manual tenant registrations: private GHCR pull identity, cosign-verifying OCI source, managed Pod Security namespace, `tenant-edit` ServiceAccount binding, Flux source/impersonation/target namespace, and the exact OpenBao policy and Kubernetes-auth role that let the renamed tenant read and seed only its own app secrets |
| `scripts/platform-network-floor*.test.sh` | Binds Platform's generated default-deny, DNS, and standard NetworkPolicy floor to the scaffold's required Gateway, namespace, CNPG, Kubernetes API, and DNS paths, reporting a check that cannot read its input separately from a policy verdict |
| `scripts/platform-vpa-floor*.test.sh` | Keeps the scaffold's initial CPU request at or above Platform's generated Deployment VPA floor, with live-policy and mutation coverage |

**Yours (list these in `.templatesyncignore`):**

`AGENTS.md` and the `maintain` skill ship as scaffolding (a starting point for new
tenants) but are **yours** — they carry your project-specific overview, so they are
ignored from sync. `.github/CODEOWNERS` is likewise yours: it names *your* tenant's
code owners, so template-sync never overwrites it.

## How publishing works

`release.yaml` turns Conventional-Commit merges to `main` into `vX.Y.Z` tags.
Each tag triggers `cd.yaml`, which calls the platform's
[`publish-app.yaml`](https://github.com/devantler-tech/actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-app.yaml)
reusable workflow to build the image, **pin its digest into
`deploy/deployment.yaml`**, push the manifests as an OCI artifact, and
**cosign-sign** both. The platform's `OCIRepository` verifies that signature, so
only artifacts from this trusted workflow are reconciled.

> **Convention:** the Deployment's container `name` MUST equal the repository
> name — `publish-app` pins the built image digest into the container with that
> name (`app-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}` in `cd.yaml`).

## Validate locally

Run these from the repository root:

```sh
kubectl kustomize deploy/                              # manifests build
sh scripts/rename-placeholders.test.sh                # onboarding contract
sh scripts/agent-instructions.test.sh                 # agent safety contract
sh scripts/workflow-caller-pin-contract.test.sh       # portable tenant caller-pin contract (resolves the version-comment tag on github.com and compares it with the pinned commit)
sh scripts/publish-pin-approved.test.sh               # publish-app pin approval check (reads a local approved set, never the network)
sh scripts/workflow-caller-contract.test.sh           # template-only caller/scaffold contract
sh scripts/tenant-ci-contract.test.sh                 # tenant delivery-input CI contract
sh scripts/pod-security-admission-contract.test.sh    # Pod Security workflow contract
sh scripts/tenant-rbac-contract.test.sh               # Platform tenant RBAC workflow contract
sh scripts/platform-tenant-envelope-contract.test.sh  # live Platform tenant-envelope contract
sh scripts/platform-network-floor-contract.test.sh    # generated Platform network-floor contract
sh scripts/platform-vpa-floor-contract.test.sh        # generated Platform VPA-floor contract
actionlint .github/workflows/*                         # workflows parse
```
